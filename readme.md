# CPF Validator/Generator

Simple project done while I was starting to study Python, easy and intuitive to navigate.

## Installation and use

Just copy de repo into your pc and run it
PS: You must have python installed

```bash
  # copy the repo
  git clone git@github.com:ThiDurante/CPF-Validator-Generator-in-python.git
  # go inside the folder that you copied
  cd locationOfFiles
  # run the script!
  py cpf.py
```

Depending on your configuration you need to run it with python cpf.py instead of py
